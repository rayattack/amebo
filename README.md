**HTTP Event Notifications Server** - A lightweight, schema-driven event broadcasting system for microservices and distributed applications.

Amebo simplifies event-driven architecture by providing a centralized hub for publishing, validating, and distributing events across your applications with built-in schema registry and webhook delivery.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 High Performance**: Sub-10ms response times with 1000+ events/second throughput
- **📋 Schema Registry**: Built-in JSON Schema validation for all events
- **🔄 Reliable Delivery**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **🐳 Production Ready**: Docker support with clustering and monitoring
- **🛡️ Secure**: JWT authentication and webhook signature verification
- **📊 Observable**: Comprehensive metrics and health checks

## 🏗️ Core Concepts

Amebo has just **4 simple concepts** to master:

1. **Applications** - Services that publish and consume events
2. **Actions** - Event types with JSON Schema validation
3. **Events** - Actual occurrences of actions with payloads
4. **Subscriptions** - Webhook endpoints that receive events

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Start Amebo with PostgreSQL
docker run -d \
  --name amebo \
  -p 3310:3310 \
  -e AMEBO_DSN="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/amebo" \
  rayattack/amebo:latest
```

### Python Package

```bash
pip install amebo
amebo --workers 2 --address 0.0.0.0:3310
```

### Example Usage

```bash
# 1. Register an application
curl -X POST http://localhost:3310/v1/applications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "application": "user-service",
    "address": "https://users.myapp.com",
    "secret": "your-secret-key"
  }'

# 2. Define an action with schema
curl -X POST http://localhost:3310/v1/actions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "user.created",
    "application": "user-service",
    "schemata": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": {"type": "string"},
        "email": {"type": "string", "format": "email"}
      },
      "required": ["id", "email"]
    }
  }'

# 3. Publish an event
curl -X POST http://localhost:3310/v1/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "user.created",
    "payload": {
      "id": "user-123",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
  }'
```

### 🐍 Python Client

Prefer not to hand-roll HMAC signing? Use the bundled [`amebo-client`](clients/python) SDK — it signs
requests (with optional replay protection) and verifies inbound webhooks for you:

```python
from amebo_client import AmeboClient, verify_webhook

amebo = AmeboClient("http://localhost:3310", application="user-service", secret=SECRET)
amebo.publish("user.created", {"id": "user-123", "email": "john@example.com"}, deduper="user-123")

# in your webhook handler
if not verify_webhook(request_body, request_headers["x-amebo-signature"], SECRET):
    ...  # reject: bad signature
```

## 🌍 Etymology

The word "amebo" is West African slang (Nigerian origin) for someone who never keeps what you tell them to themselves - a chronic gossip who spreads news everywhere. Perfect for an event broadcasting system! 😄
