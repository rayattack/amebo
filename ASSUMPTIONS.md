# Assumptions
- Engineers are blocked 
- 



## As a developer won't feel the project is useful if I don't benefit, and I want to play and experiment with it.

- Generation is more important than validation
- Validation is more important than Generation


- importance of local environment, symfony bundle approach


- asking for possible edge cases, importance of edge cases - evolution for instance, reverting merge request

- schema registry in production is a deal breaker

- upgrade to the latest version of messaging library

- we have schemas by default generated for all event DTOs
