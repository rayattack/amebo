# Amebo Wishlist

These wishlist will strive to be democratic ad infinitum.

- Stop trying to send payload to a subscriber after trying for $MAX_RETRIES. Currently tries resending forever? DONE✔
- Require event secret key when registering an action for that event. Currently anyone can fire any registered event? DONE✔
- Password protect UI. Currently open locally to anyone that has access to the amebo server internal network? DONE✔
- ADD MODAL to show row items in full screen mode on click on commensurate row of table? DONE✔
- ADD ignore_before field to gists to add send later feature? DONE✔ 
- Bring You Own Desire (submit wishlists...)


## Remember Amebo is a use as is open source library. It works, try it and see for yourself - even over 10k event workloads per second. See something you don't like? Fork, Open An Issue, Contribute, Happy hacking -\__(*_*)__/-
