# Applications Management

Learn how to effectively manage applications in Amebo for optimal event-driven communication.

## Overview

Applications are the foundation of Amebo's event system. This guide covers advanced application management topics beyond the basic registration covered in the [Getting Started](../getting-started/first-steps.md) guide.

## Application Lifecycle

### 1. Planning Phase

Before registering applications, consider:

- **Naming conventions**: Use consistent, descriptive names
- **Service boundaries**: Define clear responsibilities
- **Event ownership**: Determine which events each application owns
- **Integration patterns**: Plan how applications will communicate

### 2. Registration

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/v1/applications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "application": "user-service",
    "address": "https://users.myapp.com",
    "secret": "secure-webhook-secret"
  }'
```

### 3. Configuration Management

Applications can be updated after registration:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost/v1/applications/user-service \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "address": "https://new-users.myapp.com",
    "secret": "new-webhook-secret"
  }'
```

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent naming:

```bash
# Good examples
user-service
payment-gateway
notification-engine
analytics-collector

# Avoid
svc1
app
my-service
```

### Security

1. **Strong secrets**: Use cryptographically secure random strings
2. **Secret rotation**: Regularly update webhook secrets
3. **HTTPS only**: Always use HTTPS endpoints in production
4. **Validation**: Verify webhook signatures

### Monitoring

Track application health:

- Registration status
- Webhook delivery success rates
- Response times
- Error rates

## Advanced Topics

### Multi-Environment Setup

Manage applications across environments:

```bash
# Development
curl -X POST http://dev-amebo/v1/applications \
  -d '{"application": "user-service", "address": "https://dev-users.myapp.com"}'

# Production
curl -X POST http://prod-amebo/v1/applications \
  -d '{"application": "user-service", "address": "https://users.myapp.com"}'
```

### Application Groups

Organize related applications:

```bash
# Core services
user-service
auth-service
profile-service

# Business logic
order-service
payment-service
inventory-service

# External integrations
email-service
sms-service
analytics-service
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Duplicate application names**
   - Solution: Use unique, descriptive names

2. **Webhook delivery failures**
   - Check endpoint accessibility
   - Verify SSL certificates
   - Validate response codes

3. **Secret mismatches**
   - Ensure secrets match between Amebo and application
   - Check for encoding issues
